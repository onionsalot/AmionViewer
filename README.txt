About Project:
AmionViewer's concept revolves around the idea that less is more.
This application's use will be to provide admitting staff with an easy to follow call schedule that is easy to read, simple to digest, and customizable. By showing only relevant info to the staff, they are in turn able to dedicate less time to searching for this information and more time to other less mundane tasks. 
Each time the application is opened, it will read from Amion.com and process the information in real time before presenting it back to the user. In future iterations, possible features include:

Automation: Filling out common fields automatically
Themes: Gray is boring
Sites: Additional Montefiore sites
Phone numbers: More sites also means more needs. Call schedule will need to be placed for Transfer Center needs
